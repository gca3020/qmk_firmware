# Massdrop Ctrl - Geoff Custom

This keymap is here to show some love to the MD Ctrl.

## Layers

### Typing Layer

## Features

These are the features currently supported by this keymap:

### Debounce

Leveraged additional debounce and matrix scan time to resolve key chatter observed on this board.

### Tapdance Keys

Not really a feature. I just want to document what tapdance keys this keymap has because there will be many of them.

1. LCTRL sends LCTRL for single tap and LCTRL+LALT+T for double tap, which opens terminal in most environments.

## Future Work

1. Update function layer to be better
2. Figure out why scroll lock won't toggle
3. Debounce? Determine if it's still required or not.
